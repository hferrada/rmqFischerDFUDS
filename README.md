# rmqFischerDFUDS
This code creates a data structure to compute, in constant time, the RMQ(i,j) on an array of long integers.  The size for array of considerable length is around of 2.3n bits.

Description:<br />
This is an RMQ compressed data structure. The implementation is based on the method of Fischer and Heun [1].<br />
Their method uses a tree representation with DFUDS. We use Range Min-Max Tree of Sadakane and Navarro [2].<br />
In order to reduce the size, our rmq uses a simplified version of the Range min-max tree of Navarro and Sadakane [2], we used the forward minimum array to store the ranges (only for forward) and maximum backward array (only backward).<br />
We included an small example ("rmqFischerDFUDS.cpp") to show how to use it and included an small experiment for the time. This works only for 64 bits and supporting long sequences.

Make:<br />
To make the library just give the command 'make', this will create the lib: 'rmqFischer.a'.

Compile:<br />
To use the library you must compile your program linking 'rmqFischer.a' and include the file "DFUDSrmq.h" in your sorce code.<br />
For example to compiling the file rmqFischerDFUDS.cpp (included here) we will run:<br />
g++ rmqFischerDFUDS.cpp -o rmqFischerTest -O3 rmqFischer.a or simply run the command 'make test'. it will create the binary 'rmqFischerTest'. This binary have to recieve 7 parameter:<br />
1.- n: the length of random sequence.<br />
2.- 0/1: to load from a file(0) or create(1) the complete structure.<br />
3.- saveLoadFile: the file (the path will be included) to store the data structure in order that you can load this later.<br />
4.- repetitions: number of repetitions for experiments.<br />
5.- pseudoSorted: 1 indicated that the input array will be encrease pseudo-sorted.<br />
6.- RandomWeight: if the file is in mode pseudo-sorted, then A[i] will be a arondom value in the range [i-weight, i+weight].<br />
7.- resultsFile: the file to store the esperiments's results.<br />

For example, this line execute the code for n=10^4, stores the data in './rmqF-data.rmq' and the results in rmq-fischerRandom.txt:<br />
./rmqFischerTest 10000 1 rmqF-data.rmq 2000000 0 10000 rmq-fischerRandom.txt
